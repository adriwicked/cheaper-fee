A web app to calculate the cheapest fee for your bitcoin transactions

One of the main criticisms that bitcoin currently receives is that the transaction fees are very high.

And this is true, but the problem for many newcomers is that they don’t know that they can configure their wallet to set the exact fee they want to pay. And if you already know that, it’s not an easy process to check the status of the mempool and calculate what is the minimum amount you should pay.

Because of this I started to develop this simple web app that facilitates the calculation of the fee according to the time you are willing to wait for the transaction to be confirmed.

This tool uses the bitcoinfees.earn.com API and presents the information simplified and in multiple units for greater convenience.
